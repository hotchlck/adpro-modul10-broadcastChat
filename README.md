##  2.1: Original code, and how it run
<img src= "img/2.1.png">

In the displayed image, there are one server (in the left corner) and three clients (in the other three windows) on different terminals. The server is run using the command `cargo run --bin server`, while each client is run with `cargo run --bin client`. From the server window, it's evident that there are three connections from the three clients, each with different ports. When a message is inputted in one of the clients, the server broadcasts this message to the other clients.
